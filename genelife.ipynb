    "# Based on Conway game of Life code by electronut.in as modified by Takashi Ikegami \n",
    "\n",
    "# Description:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A simple Python/matplotlib implementation of Conway's Game of Life is\n",
    "# extended to include the influence of genes proliferating as directed by the game\n",
    "# and influencing the random innovations in the game\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Individuals (with a gene) are associated only with \"live\" or \"on\" or \"1\" sites \n",
    "# Individuals die and genes destroyed when a site \"dies\" i.e. is set to \"empty\" or \"off\" or \"0\"\n",
    "# Individuals replicate with point mutation in current version, later recombination\n",
    "# Normal replication is possible only to central empty (0) site and when 3 individuals are in neighborhood\n",
    "# The parent for mutation during replication is chosen randomly from neighbors\n",
    "# Conway's game of life rule is overridden stochastically only for empty sites with 2 or 3 neighbors present (on)\n",
    "#   The probability of rule override p=p0*e^-d decays exponentially with increasing hamming distance d of neighbors\n",
    "#   (i) In the case of three live neighbors, the central site remains dead and no replication happens\n",
    "#   (ii)In the case of two live neightbors, the central site comes alive and replication happens.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For p0 == 0, the occupied cells follow exactly Conway's game of life\n",
    "#   and the genes execute neutral selection from an initially random population\n",
    "# For p0 >0, the probability of departures from Conway's rules are greatest with monoclonal neighbors\n",
    "#   and become negligible if neighbors are distantly related\n",
    "# In this way, a feedback is created between pattern stagnation and innovation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# With the current parameters, no degeneration to a set of non-communicating local structures occurs\n",
    "# The model is likely to be more interesting still with recombination than point mutation NYI\n",
