Genetic extension to Conway's Game of Life
by John McCaskill and Norman Packard

Conway's Game of Life (GoL) is extended to include the influence of genes
proliferating as part of the dynamics. The birth of a cell, depends
on the presence of live neighbours and their genes determine the gene
of the newly born cell. The model optionally further breaks the
(semi-totalistic) symmetry of the GoL, in four steps, allowing the genes
to determine rules depending not just on the number of live neighbours.
Genetic and spatial patterns occuring in the simulation are recorded and
activity statistics, genealogies and a portfolio of other graphical
analysis tools provided. 

Further details are available in the LNCS publication by the authors
